# IB-Device-Programming
This is the repository for Cambridge Engineering Department Part IB Coursework 'Device Programming'. Embedded C++ is used to control an ESP32 microcontroller performing the following activities:
1. **Configurable alternating LED display**: LED records down user input of desired LED sequence (record the colour when the button is pressed), and displays the recorded sequence.
2. **I2C Temperature Sensing**: Real-time temperature sensing using I2C Protocol, with LM75 temperature sensor.
